# Deploy a Simple Flask App on AWS EC2

This project is a very simple **Flask To-Do web application** created for the purpose of learning **how to use AWS EC2** and **deploy a web application on the cloud**.  

## Objective
- Understand how to launch and connect to an AWS EC2 instance.  
- Learn how to install the required dependencies on the instance.  
- Deploy a simple Flask app and access it through the EC2 public IP.  

## About the App
The app is a **minimal To-Do list application** built with Flask.  
It has a very simple layout where users can add and view tasks.  

## What I Learned
- How to create and configure an EC2 instance on AWS.  
- How to connect to EC2 using SSH.  
- How to set up Python, Flask, and run a web application on the server.  
- How to configure security group inbound rules to make the app accessible via browser.  

## Purpose
This project is **not about building a complex app**, but mainly to understand:  
- The basics of **AWS EC2**  
- **Hosting and deployment** of a Flask application on the cloud
